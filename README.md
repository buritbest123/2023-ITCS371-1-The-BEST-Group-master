**Sep 2023 - Nov 2023**  
**Faculty of Information and Communication Technology (ICT), Mahidol University** 🎓💻

The **Job Center System** is a dynamic software development simulation designed to guide development teams through a comprehensive 4-phase cycle 🔄. This project aims to streamline the recruitment process, providing an efficient bridge between job seekers and recruitment entities. 👨‍💼👩‍💼

## Project Overview 📜

### Phases of Development 🛠️

1. **Phase 0: Requirements Gathering 📋**  
   Teams collect and document the system's functional and non-functional requirements. ✍️

2. **Phase 1: Use Case Analysis 📊**  
   A use case diagram and narrative are developed to represent user interactions with the system. 👥📝

3. **Phase 2: Data Flow and Functional Decomposition 🔍**  
   Detailed **Data Flow Diagrams** (Level 0, 1, and 2) and **Functional Decomposition Diagrams** are created to map out the system's structure. 🧩🔗

4. **Phase 3: Prototype and Testing 🚀**  
   A **Mock-up prototype** is designed along with comprehensive **test cases** to ensure the system meets its requirements. 🖼️✅

### Cutting-Edge Technologies 🔧🚀

The system integrates several advanced technologies to enhance the recruitment experience:

- **Microsoft Azure OCR**: 🧾🔍 Optical Character Recognition for scanning and reading documents.
- **2C2P Payment API**: 💳 Secure payment integration for transaction processing.
